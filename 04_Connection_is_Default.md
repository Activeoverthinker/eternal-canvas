## THE CLAIM

**Division is learned. Connection is the natural state.**

- Babies don't hate
- Racism is taught
- Tribalism is installed
- Fear is programmed

**Related:** [[04_Core_Tenets_and_Canons]] - Core Belief: Connection is Default

## THE EVIDENCE

### Developmental

**Infants prefer helpers over hinderers** (innate moral sense)

**Children naturally share** (before taught scarcity)

**Toddlers comfort crying peers** (spontaneous empathy)

**Young kids don't see race until taught to**

**Division requires active programming. Connection is automatic.**

### Neurological

**Mirror neurons create automatic empathy**

**Oxytocin bonds us to others**

**Social pain activates same brain regions as physical pain**

**We're biologically wired for cooperation**

**Related:** [[09_Brain_on_Dissociatives]] - Neural synchronization mechanisms

### Anthropological

**Humans survived through cooperation at scale**

**Most human history:** small bands sharing resources

**Recent history (10,000 years):** hierarchies emerged

**Collaboration is older and deeper than competition**

**Related:** [[02_The_Cognitive_Revolution]] - The ancient unity

## HOW DIVISION IS INSTALLED

**The Sick Machine actively teaches division:**

- Media amplifies differences, ignores commonalities
- Economic system pits workers against each other
- Political system creates binary teams
- Education system ranks and separates
- Marketing creates artificial tribes

**Division is profitable. Connection threatens power.**

**Related:** [[03_The_Sick_Machine]] - The designed disconnection

## THE PRACTICE

### Default to Connection

**Assume good intent until proven otherwise**

**Look for commonality before focusing on difference**

**Ask "What shaped them?" before "What's wrong with them?"**

### This Doesn't Mean Naivety

- Maintain boundaries (boundaries are compassion)
- Recognize harmful patterns
- Protect yourself

**But lead with connection, not suspicion.**

## FOR THE MOVEMENT

**The Eternal Canvas assumes connection:**

**We're all expressions of [[02_The_Canvas_Thesis|Art]] (the universal force)**

**We're all caught in [[03_The_Sick_Machine|The Sick Machine]] (shared struggle)**

**We're all capable of awakening (shared potential)**

**The movement weaves threads together, resisting system that wants us divided.**
